# Mobile-Flashcards Project

Mobile-Flashcards Project provides an interface that allows a user to

* Add decks and flashcards,
* View an individual deck, and
* Take a quiz and view result based on the flashcards of an individual deck.
* A local notification at 8pm every day if the user hasn't completed a quiz yet in a day.

Mobile-Flashcards Project has been tested and it works correctly (especially the local notification feature) in Android emulator and Android real device.

## Steps to Install Mobile-Flashcards Demo

1. Install Android Studio and a virtual device (Nexus 5X API 27 x86).

2. Install Expo XDE.

3. Turn on the virtual device.

4. On your bash terminal, run the following code:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MacauWinston/reactnd-project-mobile-flashcards.git
cd reactnd-project-mobile-flashcards
npm install
```

5. Open Expo XDE and, in the "Open existing project" section, select "reactnd-project-mobile-flashcards" of your installed folder. This will go to the Expo XDE log screen.

6. Click "Device" at the top right corner and select "Open on Android". After "building the JavaScript bundle", the Mobile-Flashcards demo is loaded onto the Android emulator.

Enjoy!
